		<p>So, how long the pomaranian lives?</p>
		
		<p>In the DogGos, I would be life for 100 years, but whem I arrived to Midhard, the time of my living became shorter. The longest, I can live around 16 years. Sure, I will be have problems with health which I wouldn't have had in my palnet DogGos. For example, the hip dysplasia, early tooth loss, eyes and ears sickness as well. But, we good daily routine care, I will be get rid of this problems and will be live happy, and long life.</p>
		
		<p>It was just a basic nformation about my breed, so let's return to the my story, story of Pom. Yes, I also became old, but I had a beautiful and happy life with my true friend the Queen Chalotte. She loved me a lot, and care of me every day. So, I had less problems with my hrealth like other dogs on the Midhard planet.</p>
		
		<p>I lived 20 years full of joys, games with my true friend, my favorite royal bed and food, oh yes.... and fasion clothes for dogs. Every day I visted spa salon, and dog's park where I made a lot of friends. Every weekened, I was making a party in the castel. I realy had a wonderful life and I am thankful for this.</p>
		
		<p>Here is one more thing the funny poem of Pamaranian Shpitz. </p>
		
		<p>Shpitz is a funny puppy, running around the field at random.</p>
		<p>He wags his tail briskly,</p>
		<p>happily greets his friends.</p>
		<p>He is small in height,</p>
		<p>his coat is warm, and tail is bushy.</p>
		<p>So, you won't immediately say,</p>
		<p>that the baby is a brave like a lion.</p>
