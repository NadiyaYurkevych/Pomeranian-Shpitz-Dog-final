		<p>How am I looking? Well, as you guys now know I(Pom) was original from planet DogGos which has a orange sky...So, most of my breed had a orange or dark red color. When I arrived to Midhard planet, my color become changing because of the climate, atmoshere, and much other factors...When, I meet with Queen Charlotte, I had a red color like my ancestors had. At the end of XIX centrury the other Pomarainas of palnte's DogGos left the GodGos and arrived to Midhard because they were standing againt the strong lows of GodGos...They as well as me wanted to find a true friend.</p>
		
		<p>They found me some how, and I was very surprised,you not beliave me, but we became best friends. Doring the living on a new planet which we(Pomaranians) used to call it our new HOME we started to mix with each other and because of the different atmoshere and other staff, the new Pomaranieas have been born with different colors.</p>
		
		<p>Nowdays, you can observe the us(Pomaranias) with vary appearance. We can be white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti. The most common colors of us are orange, black, or cream/white.</p>
		
		<p> Now, let's talk about my behavior. This will be intersing.</p>
