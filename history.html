		<p>So, let's talk about how I came to this planet, met the queen Charlotte, and bacame her a roal dog. As I said my story took the beggining in the XVIII centry. The Quenn Charlotte was very sad in her kingdom in England. She was very lonely from ther childhood becuse she didn't have any friends to play with. Every night she was praying to God and ask of special friend who always will be with her and will cheer her up.</p>
		
		<p>But, she didn't realized that somewhere in the Galaxy far away from our planet Midhard was another planet. It called DogGos. The palnet of DogGos was unsuall. It has a red grass and orange sky. Also, the unusual thing was about this planet is that there were no people. Only small, fluffy  pomaranian - dogs. They had thair own lows, rules, and language. One of the low was very serious. It was saying: "Don't have any owner and not talk with people. But, one dog was disagree anout this low. Yes,it was me the Pom. I was feeling very sad and wanted to have a true frined. In one night, I stoled the flyingt ship and left the DogGos forever. I even broke my GPS that the security of DogGos will not find me. I flew to the Midhard planet where a small girl was praying for ture friend. The way to Midhard palent took me a lot way. Eproximatelly, 1,000 solar years.</p>
		
		<p>So, when I arrived to Midhard planet, I saw the carrige that was driving in trougth the forest. In the carrige was a real and very royal queen. Yea...It was she... That small, and sad girl who was praying for a true friend. The Charlotte. As years, passeed, she become the Queen of England. She saw me in the road and asked to stop the carrige. </p>
		
		<p>She went out of the carrige and walked to me. She sat in the green grass next to me, and looked into my brown eyes. YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS....That was a moment when we found each other. We found a TRUE FRIEND in each other. She took me to her kingdom and I became the royal dog.</p>
